Reliability, accuracy, ease of handling, simple maintenance, and safety — all the elements of HK excellence are highlighted on the MP5. Firing from the closed-bolt position in all modes of fire make MP5 submachine guns extremely accurate and controllable.

All HK MP5 models are manufactured using time-tested Heckler & Koch technological invocation and superior materials. Barrels are made using cold hammer forging, a process pioneered and perfected by HK. Machined and stamped high strength steel and modern polymers make up the rest of the MP5. Continual product improvements over more than 50 years of production have kept the MP5 up-to-date and technologically current; it is firmly established as the world’s pre-eminent submachine gun among military and law enforcement users.

Over 120 MP5 variants are available to address the widest range of tactical requirements. A selection of optional trigger groups allow for single fire only, full automatic, 2-round, and 3-round burst options. The weapon’s unique modular design and a variety of optional buttstocks, forearms, sight mounts, magazines, and other accessories gives the MP5 extraordinary flexibility to meet most any mission requirement.",Category 10,Assault Rifles (less than .50 caliber),Heckler and Koch,https://hk-usa.com/,Heckler and Koch,https://hk-usa.com/hk-models/mp5-2/,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:MP5k.JPG,1500,,
